# House_price_prediction_Project

A full-scale regression project on real estate data, combining deep data cleaning, statistical rigor, and diverse predictive models.

1. Smart Data Cleaning

Parsed nested features like additionalRoom, rating, and furnishDetails into structured, model-ready columns
Applied one-hot encoding, dropped noisy text columns, and handled NaNs intelligently

2. Regression Assumption Diagnostics
   
Linearity via Residual vs Fitted plots
Multicollinearity via VIF scores
Normality via Q-Q Plot + Shapiro-Wilk Test
Outliers via standardized residuals
Homoscedasticity via residual spread analysis

3.Predictive Modeling: From Scratch to Neural Nets
   
📐 Custom implementations: OLS, Gradient Descent, Lasso & Ridge
🧠 ML Models: SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
⚙️ Deep Learning: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for capturing complex patterns

A perfect blend of statistical foundations and practical ML — built for robustness and interpretability.
